                    in 18 markets, entered the German market in 2022
                    with our bio-organism-based biofertilizer. Finding
                    a reliable partner for Influencer Marketing was
                    crucial as it is our primary sales channel.
                    <br><br>
                    We chose BURmedia due to our alignment
                    with its founder Misha's views on business.
                    BURmedia professionally facilitated relationships
                    with dozens of bloggers and ensured legal compliance in Germany's highly regulated influencer market.
                    <br><br>
                    Together, we launched our product, completed over 30 collaborations with influencers, and established key relationships with niche gardening bloggers like Pflanzenarzt. BURmedia, especially Ana, provided exceptional project management and expertise,
                    ensuring timely completion of all collaborations
                    and weekly progress reports.
